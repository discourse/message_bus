module MessageBus
  module Backends
    # Backends provide a consistent API over a variety of options for persisting
    # published messages. The API they present is around the publication to and
    # reading of messages from those backlogs in a manner consistent with
    # message_bus' philosophy.
    #
    # The heart of the message bus, a backend acts as two things:
    #
    # 1. A channel multiplexer
    # 2. Backlog storage per-multiplexed channel.
    #
    # Backends manage and expose multiple backlogs:
    #
    # * A backlog for each channel, in which messages that were published to
    #   that channel are stored.
    # * A global backlog, which conceptually stores all published messages,
    #   regardless of the channel to which they were published.
    #
    # Backlog storage mechanisms and schemas are up to each individual backend
    # implementation, and some backends store messages very differently than
    # others. It is not necessary in order to be considered a valid backend,
    # to, for example, store each channel backlog as a separate collection.
    # As long as the API is presented per this documentation, the backend is
    # free to make its own storage and performance optimisations.
    #
    # The concept of a per-channel backlog permits for lookups of messages in
    # a manner that is optimised for the use case of a subscriber catching up
    # from a message pointer, while a global backlog allows for optimising the
    # case where another system subscribes to the firehose of messages, for
    # example a message_bus server receiving all publications for delivery
    # to subscribed clients.
    #
    # Backends are fully responsible for maintaining their storage, including
    # any pruning or expiration of that storage that is necessary. message_bus
    # allows for several options for limiting the required storage capacity
    # by either backlog size or the TTL of messages in a backlog. Backends take
    # these settings and effect them either forcibly or by delegating to their
    # storage mechanism.
    #
    # Message which are published to message_bus have two IDs; one which they
    # are known by in the channel-specific backlog that they are published to,
    # and another (the "global ID") which is unique across all channels and by
    # which the message can be found in the global backlog. IDs are all
    # sequential integers starting at 0.
